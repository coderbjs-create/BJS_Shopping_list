    <h1>About!</h1>
    <hr>

        <h2>More about the creator:  </h2>
        <p>Hello, I am BJS. In the homepage, I had been talking in an third person point of view(POV).
            I had created this website in my winter vacation. I live in Bangladesh(BD). I read in
            St.Joseph International School in Mohammadpur, Dhaka. My email is coderbjs@gmail.com
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Resources used:  </h2>
        <p>This section gives attributes to the resources used! Mainly, I used Hypertext Markup
            Language(HTML) for structure. Then I used Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) for styling. And
            finally I used Javascript(JS) for functionality. In short, I used HTML+CSS for frontend
            and JS for backend. And for the {Feedback} section, I used service of the formsubmit.co 
            website. We used Github for hosting this website.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Functionality:  </h2>
        <p>
            This page's main functionality is to help you manage your shopping list. Shopping lists
            can go really messi, that is why I created this website to help you in it. This shopping
            list apperently has 5 functions. Those functions have been mentioned in the homepage from
            earlier. Here, the shopping list is stored locally on your device, NOT in our servers.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>A bit about the frontend:  </h2>
        <p>
            Again, our frontend is created in HTML+CSS+JS. In any button you click, you will almost
            always find a few common patterns. First, being that every single option's background is
            gradient. It was made using the {linear-gradient} function of CSS in the background-image
            options. Then, for tasks, you will always find a window. It was created using divs and 
            margin customization. Then, in almost all options, you will find a terminal/console/blank box,
            which is white. It will give you confirmation after your input. In the {Remove an item.} and
            {Remove all items.} options, when you try to delete something, an pop-up window will appear
            for confirmation. Important Note though, that this website is better suited to be visited
            from a desktop, not mobile/tabs. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>A bit about the backend:  </h2>
        <p>
            The backend, is entirely written in pure/vanilla JS. For the {shopping list}, it is
            being stored in your browser as local storage. We used operations like localStorage.get()
            , LocalStorage.remove() functions to manipulate that. The terminals/consoles/blank boxes'
            texts are functions from JS.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Security and assurence:  </h2>
        <p>
            We do assure absolute safety from our website. If your device starts having problems
            after you visited or interacted with our site, it is likely not our issue. But, if you 
            really think it is, then feel free to ask questions, or give feedback. We, also operate with maximum 
            anonymity. Your [data] is ensured to be safe unless you/3rd party/others operate
            with the data. Only possible ways your device may be under security unease are: 1.
            Fake copy website. 2. Other's controls over your device. 3. [Least likely] Interception
            between data transfer in the only possible way, which is through the {Ask Questions}
            option. If you are in our real website, you are pretty much guaranteed to not be
            under security leaks from this web's uses.

        <h2>Function of: {Add an item.}:  </h2>
        <p>
            The function of {Add an item.} is fairly simple. What it does is that, it takes
            a item from you, then, it tries to add it your shopping list. Now, you cannot just 
            give in input as empty or only whitespaces, right? That's when the error message pops-up
            in the respective terminal/console/blank box. Except, it takes your input, lowercases
            every single letter in that your input/item, and then it stores it in that shopping list. 
            However, if you try to enter an item which already exists(Letter foramtting doesn't matter),
            then an error message will pop-up in the respective terminal/console/blank box.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Function of: {View all items.}:  </h2>
        <p>
            The function of {Add an item.} is fairly simple. Well, when you go to this option, there will be a {!Show Results!} button.
            Then, you click that. Then, if your terminal/console/blank box shows [There is nothing in the shopping list..]
            error, that means that {Shopping list} in your local storage does not have any items in it.
            This may also happen if local storage does not even has {Shopping list}. Except this, you will
            find that all your items are shown beautifully in the terminal/console/blank box. They, sure
            will have double numbering, but it's for decoration.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Function of: {Check an item.}:  </h2>
        <p>
            The function of {Check an item.} is fairly simple. When you go to this option, it will
            have 2 windows. In one, you can search simple. the item's name(Letter foramtting doesn't matter).
            And in the other, you can search the item's index. Note, in this website, indexing starts
            from 1, not 0. If input is empty or only has whitespaces, the terminal/console/blank box 
            will raise an error. And, if your item's name/index does not exist, then it will also raise
            an error. Except, it will confirm you it's existence. To get result, click on the {!Submit!}
            button.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Function of: {Remove all item.}:  </h2>
        <p>
            The function of {Check an item.} is fairly simple. When you go to this option, you will
            see a {!Delete now!} option. If you click on that button, an pop-up window will appear.
            Then, your background will go dark and gloomy. That is just for visual effects. Any button
            you click, it will raise a {Operation was a Success} message in the terminal/console/blank box.
            If you click the {Yes} button, your entire shopping list's items will be removed. The {No, Close}
            buttons do nothing, they just close the pop-up window.
        </p>

            in the terminal/console/blank box. If you click the {Yes} button, your that item from the 
            entire shopping list's items will be removed. The {No, Close} buttons do nothing, 
            they just close the pop-up window.
